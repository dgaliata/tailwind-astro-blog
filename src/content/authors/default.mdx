ðŸ‘‹ Hello ~

Thanks for visiting my blog! My name is David. I earned my stripes in corporate IT and have over 10 years of experience in consulting. I currently work as a Principal Security Architect, focusing on cloud security solutions. 

I am dedicated to lifelong learning and passionate about DevOps, Cybersecurity, and Cloud technologies.

My technical background includes:
- Server infrastructure
- Networking
- Virtualization
- Cloud services
- Cybersecurity

In addition to my technical interests, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing and listening to music, coaching/playing/refereeing soccer, chess, and reading.
