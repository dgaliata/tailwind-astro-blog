# Introduction

If you're reading this, you're probably either preparing for the Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) exam or considering taking it. I can tell you, cracking this exam is a challenging yet rewarding journey that significantly boosted my understanding of cloud security. Earlier this month I provisionally passed the CCSP exam, and I want to share my experience and tips to help you succeed too.

# Why CCSP?

Before diving into the study tips, let me quickly explain why I chose the CCSP certification. I currently work as a security architect and deal with cloud security in my day to day activities. Iâ€™ve always recognized the CCSP as a globally recognized certification that demonstrates your expertise in cloud security architecture, governance, risk management, and compliance. It was on my radar for quite some time, and I finally decided to dedicate focused time to it to enhance my knowledge and career prospects.

# Study Materials I Used

## **Official Study Guide**

This is the first book I read, as it is listed as the official CCSP study guide. I know some people use this is their primary resource, but I'd say this is more of an introduction to all the concepts covering all six domains in detail. It also provides practice questions at the end of each chapter. I found it to be a good resource for building a strong foundation and understanding the scope of the exam.

## **CSA Guidance and Security as a Service Docs**

I found the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) documentation from a recommendation from Gwen Bettwy on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/). These documents are extremely valuable, especially for domains related to identity, cloud architecture, and governance. I spent considerable time reading through their guidance to understand best practices and dive more into identity federation and SAML.

## **Practice Tests**

I used [Pocket Prep's](https://www.pocketprep.com/) CCSP practice tests as my primary test bank. The questions are well-crafted and help you identify areas where you need more focus. I did all 1,000 of them and obtained a score of 82% overall. The one thing I liked about these practice tests is that they included citations from the OSG and CBK books on where to find the topics covered in the question. It also explained why the wrong answers were wrong and provided a note on why the correct answer was indeed correct.

## **Aluko's Website**

[Alukoâ€™s](https://ccsp.alukos.com/) website is a treasure trove of resources. The notes and summaries provided there are excellent for quick revisions and clearing up any lingering doubts. I used this to follow up on some of the topics I was scoring lower on in the practice exams. Definitely recommend this resource!

## **YouTube Resources**

I heard great things about the [CCSP Exam Cram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFZWMZIy5LM&list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_X0AupQwU8YOGV3TsoPAcD0) so I decided to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this content is. I can't believe it's free. I watched this and made notes and then re-watched some of the sections. This was incredibly valuable, and I definitely recommend using this as a tool for the exam.

Another YouTube resource I highly recommend is Gwen Bettwy's test-taking tips. These are short videos, but she has really mastered the "mindset" that is needed for the exam. I watched these the day before my exam, and I truly believe they helped me.

# My Study Plan

## **1\. Understanding the Domains**

The CCSP exam is divided into six domains, and it's vital to have a strong grasp of each:

* Cloud Concepts, Architecture, and Design
    
* Cloud Data Security
    
* Cloud Platform & Infrastructure Security
    
* Cloud Application Security
    
* Cloud Security Operations
    
* Legal, Risk, and Compliance
    

I dedicated about two weeks to each domain, ensuring I fully understood the concepts before moving on to the next. I focused heavily on governance and data security.

## **2\. Practice, Practice, Practice**

Taking practice exams is crucial and should not be skipped! I took the full 1,000 practice questions in the Pocket Prep app. After each test, I reviewed my answers to understand why I got certain questions wrong.

## **3\. Focusing on Weak Areas**

After a few weeks of studying, I identified my weak areas and focused on them. For me, cloud application security was challenging, so I spent extra time revisiting that domain and doing additional practice questions.

## **4\. Rest and Recap**

As the exam date approached, I made sure to get plenty of rest. I dedicated the last week before the exam to a comprehensive review of all domains, focusing on summarizing key points and concepts.

## Exam Day Tips

* **Arrive Early**: Make sure you arrive at the testing center early to avoid any last-minute stress.
    
* **Read Each Question Carefully**: The exam questions can be tricky, so take your time to understand each one before answering. Make sure you are answering to the best of your ability.
    
* **Manage Your Time**: The exam is time-bound, so keep an eye on the clock, but donâ€™t rush.
    
* **Stay Calm**: Itâ€™s natural to feel nervous (I was super nervous), but staying calm and composed is needed for this exam.
    

# Final Thoughts

The CCSP exam is not to be taken lightly, but with the right preparation, itâ€™s definitely achievable. Remember to study consistently, use multiple resources, and practice as much as possible.

Good luck on your journey to becoming a Certified Cloud Security Professional! If you have any questions or need more tips, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™m always happy to help fellow security professionals achieve their goals.
