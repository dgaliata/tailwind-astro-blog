After spending over a decade in IT consulting, patterns start to emerge. Recently, I had a discussion with a colleague about what truly makes a successful consultant - a conversation that inspired me to write this post. The difference between a skilled engineer and an effective consultant isn't always obvious on paper, but it becomes crystal clear over time. 

# The Technical Skills Trap

Many engineers fall into what I call the "technical skills trap." They can explain what a firewall is, configure VPNs, and understand networking theory. But here's the challenge: what happens when you give them two firewalls and ask them to create a site-to-site tunnel for a customer?

This isn't just a technical problem. It's a consulting challenge.

# Beyond Configuration: The Real Work

The difference between an engineer and a consultant becomes clear in these moments. A consultant needs to:

1. Coordinate with the customer to understand their needs
2. Create a comprehensive implementation plan
3. Execute the technical work
4. Manage communication throughout the process
5. Navigate constraints and roadblocks

It's not enough to know *how* to configure a firewall. You need to figure out how to deal with the current constraints, communicate effectively with the customer, develop a plan, and then implement the technical pieces.

# The Proactive Mindset

One of the most striking differences in consulting is the approach to work itself. In traditional roles, engineers often wait for work to be assigned. In consulting, you need to:

- Actively identify potential problems
- Create and manage your own backlog
- Jump in and find ways to add value
- Think ahead of current requirements

# Client Interactions: Where the Magic Happens

The hardest part of consulting often happens in client meetings. You walk in expecting to discuss a technical solution, but first you need to:

- Identify the actual pain points (which may be different from what was initially reported)
- Navigate organizational constraints
- Build trust through effective communication
- Demonstrate both technical expertise and business understanding

# Building Trust Through Execution

The real test of a consultant isn't just delivering a technical solution - it's managing the entire process from discovery to implementation. Using our firewall example:

An engineer might say: "I can configure a site-to-site VPN tunnel between these firewalls."

A consultant would say: "I'll work with your team to understand the connectivity requirements, develop a migration plan that minimizes downtime, coordinate with stakeholders at both sites, and ensure we have proper documentation and monitoring in place."

# The Consulting Culture

This mindset isn't just about individual projects - it's about developing a consultative approach to everything you do. This means:

- Taking ownership of outcomes, not just tasks
- Thinking about business impact, not just technical solutions
- Building relationships, not just systems
- Being proactive rather than reactive

# Conclusion

The transition from engineer to consultant requires a fundamental shift in mindset. While technical skills are essential, they're just the foundation. The real value of a consultant lies in their ability to:

- See the bigger picture
- Manage complex stakeholder relationships
- Drive projects from conception to completion
- Communicate effectively at all levels
- Take ownership of outcomes

Remember: in consulting, it's not just about solving technical problems - we're delivering business value through technical expertise.
