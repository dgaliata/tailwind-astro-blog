# Adding Code Block Superpowers with Expressive Code

Earlier this year, I revamped my blog with a fresh new theme. While the new design was an improvement, there was one small but annoying omission that kept bugging me: no copy button on code blocks. You know that feeling when you're reading a technical blog post and want to quickly grab a code snippet, but have to manually select everything? Yeah, that was my blog for the past few months.

## The Solution: Expressive Code

I finally got around to fixing this today by implementing [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/) in my Astro blog. I found out about it while researching random articles about adding a copy code block to an Astro site. Expressive Code is a neat code block enhancement package that not only adds a copy button but brings a suite of other features like:

- Syntax highlighting
- Code frame UI
- Light/dark theme support
- Line numbers
- Line highlighting
- Word wrap options

## Implementation Journey

The setup process was straightforward, but I did hit a small gotcha that's worth sharing. Here's how I did it:

1. First, installed the package on my local machine:
```bash
npm install astro-expressive-code
```

2. Added it to my `astro.config.mjs`:
```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
import sitemap from '@astrojs/sitemap';
import tailwind from "@astrojs/tailwind";
import solidJs from "@astrojs/solid-js";
import { SITE_METADATA } from "./src/consts.ts";
import metaTags from "astro-meta-tags";
import robotsTxt from "astro-robots-txt";
import expressiveCode from 'astro-expressive-code'

export default defineConfig({
  prefetch: true,
  site: SITE_METADATA.siteUrl,
  integrations: [
    // Move expressiveCode before mdx
    expressiveCode({
      themes: ['github-dark', 'github-light'],
      styleOverrides: {
        frames: {
          editorActiveTabIndicatorTopColor: 'transparent',
          editorActiveTabBorderColor: '#80808080',
          editorTabBarBorderBottomColor: '#80808080',
          tooltipSuccessBackground: 'black'
        },
        uiFontFamily: 'inherit',
        borderColor: '#80808080'
      }
    }),
    mdx(), 
    sitemap(), 
    tailwind(), 
    solidJs(), 
    metaTags(), 
    robotsTxt()
  ]
});
```
### The Gotcha: Integration Order Matters

Here's where I hit a small snag: initially, I placed the Expressive Code integration after my MDX integration, which resulted in an error. Luckily the Vercel deployment logs told me exactly what the issue was- Expressive Code needs to process the code blocks before MDX does its thing, so the integration needed to be placed before `mdx()` in the integrations array.

This makes sense when you think about it: Expressive Code needs to enhance the code blocks before they get processed by MDX. It's a case of order of operations being important in build configurations.

## The Result

Now my code blocks look much better and are more functional. They have:
- A sleek copy button
- Proper syntax highlighting that respects the site's theme
- A nice frame UI that makes code blocks stand out
- Better visual integration with my site's design thanks to the style customizations

## Conclusion

Sometimes small improvements make a big difference in user experience. Adding Expressive Code was one of those "why didn't I do this sooner?" updates. If you're running an Astro blog and haven't added proper code block functionality yet, I highly recommend giving Expressive Code a try. I might even look at some other themes and tweak it further.
