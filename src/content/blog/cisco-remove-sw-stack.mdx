# Intro
Last week I had to "break" a stack where there were four switches and I needed to use one outside in an IDF. This type of operation can be tricky and requires planning to ensure minimal disruption to the network. It involves not only the physical removal of the switch but also reconfiguring the remaining switches to function correctly without it. Proper execution is crucial to maintain network stability and ensure that all devices continue to communicate effectively.

# Configuration Steps

Executing the **show run** command showed there were indeed 4 switches in the stack-

```bash
switch 1 provision ws-c3750x-48p
switch 2 provision ws-c3750x-48p
switch 3 provision ws-c3750x-48p
switch 4 provision ws-c3750x-48p
```

To remove switch 4 I had to run the following command (In configuration mode)-

```bash
no switch 4 provision ws-c3750x-48p
```

**wr mem**

After that- Power down the stack, remove the necessary cables and re-cable the stack. Upon rebooting the switches you should no longer see the switch which has been removed.
